# FlameGAF-GateNet (GAF + Gated Multimodal Fusion for Flame/Smoke Detection)

This repository provides the official implementation of **FlameGAF-GateNet**, a gated multimodal framework for flame and smoke detection that combines **RGB appearance** with **temporal dynamics encoded by Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs)**.

✅ **This codebase is directly associated with the manuscript currently submitted to _The Visual Computer_:**  
**“Enhanced Flame and Smoke Detection via Gated Multimodal Fusion with Gramian Angular Fields.”**

If you find this repository useful, please consider citing our manuscript (see [Citation](#citation)).

## Highlights
- **Dual-branch architecture**: RGB branch + GAF branch.
- **GAF temporal encoding**: converts lightweight temporal descriptors into image-like GAF representations.
- **Sample-adaptive gated fusion**: learns per-sample fusion weights for robust multimodal integration.
- Reproducible training/evaluation scripts.
